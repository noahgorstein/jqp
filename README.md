This application utilizes [itchyny's](https://github.com/itchyny) implementation of `jq` written in Go, [`gojq`](https://github.com/itchyny/gojq).

## Installation

### homebrew

```bash
brew install noahgorstein/tap/jqp
```

### macports

```bash
sudo port install jqp
```

### Arch Linux
Available through the Arch User Repository as [jqp-bin](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/jqp-bin).
```bash
yay -S jqp-bin
```

### Github releases

Download the relevant asset for your operating system from the latest Github release. Unpack it, then move the binary to somewhere accessible in your `PATH`, e.g. `mv ./jqp /usr/local/bin`.

### Build from source

Clone this repo, build from source with `cd jqp && go build`, then move the binary to somewhere accessible in your `PATH`, e.g. `mv ./jqp /usr/local/bin`.

## Usage

```
➜ jqp --help
jqp is a TUI to explore the jq command line utility

Usage:
  jqp [flags]

Flags:
      --config string   config file (default is $HOME/.jqp.yaml)
  -f, --file string     path to the input JSON file
  -h, --help            help for jqp
  -t, --theme string    jqp theme
  -v, --version         version for jqp
```

`jqp` also supports input from STDIN. STDIN takes precedence over the command line flag.

```

```

## Keybindings

| `ctrl-y` | copy query to system clipboard[^1] |
| `ctrl-s` | save output to file (copy to clipboard if file not specified) |
| `ctrl-c` | quit program / kill long running query |

### Query Mode

| **Keybinding** | **Action** |
|:---------------|:-----------|

| `↑`/`↓` | cycle through query history |
| `ctrl-a` | go to beginning of line |
| `ctrl-e` | go to end of line |
| `←`/`ctrl-b` | move cursor one character to left |
| `→`/`ctrl-f`| move cursor one character to right |

## Configuration

`jqp` can be configured with a configuration file. By default, `jqp` will search your home directory for a YAML file named `.jqp.yaml`. A path to a YAML configuration file can also be provided to the `--config` command line flag. 

```bash
➜ jqp --config ~/my_jqp_config.yaml < data.json
```

If a configuration option is present in both the configuration file and the command line, the command line option takes precedence. For example, if a theme is specified in the configuration file and via `-t/--theme flag`, the command line flag will take precedence.

### Available Configuration Options

```yaml
theme:
  name: "nord" # controls the color scheme
  chromaStyleOverrides: # override parts of the chroma style
    kc: "#009900 underline" # keys use the chroma short names
```

## Themes

Themes can be specified on the command line via the `-t/--theme <themeName>` flag. You can also set a theme in your [configuration file](#configuration). 

```yaml
theme:
  name: "monokai"
```

### Chroma Style Overrides

Overrides to the chroma styles used for a theme can be configured in your [configuration file](#configuration). 

For the list of short keys, see [`chroma.StandardTypes`](https://github.com/alecthomas/chroma/blob/d38b87110b078027006bc34aa27a065fa22295a1/types.go#L210-L308). To see which token to use for a value, see the [JSON lexer](https://github.com/alecthomas/chroma/blob/master/lexers/embedded/json.xml) (look for `<token>` tags). To see the color and what's used in the style you're using, look for your style in the chroma [styles directory](https://github.com/alecthomas/chroma/tree/master/styles).

```yaml
theme:
  name: "monokai" # name is required to know which theme to override
  chromaStyleOverrides:
    kc: "#009900 underline"
```

You can change non-syntax colors using the `styleOverrides` key:
```yaml
theme:
  styleOverrides:
    primary: "#c4b28a"
    secondary: "#8992a7"
    error: "#c4746e"
    inactive: "#a6a69c"
    success: "#87a987"
```

Themes are broken up into [light](#light-themes) and [dark](#dark-themes) themes. Light themes work best in terminals with a light background and dark themes work best in a terminal with a dark background. If no theme is specified or a non-existant theme is provided, the default theme is used, which was created to work with both terminals with a light and dark background.
